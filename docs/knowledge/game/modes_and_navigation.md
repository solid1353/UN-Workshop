# Modes and menu navigation

## Research coverage

Established: the in-scope Mode Select loop, Free Battle and Practice setup and pause flow,
Options controls, screen-position editor and difficulty reset, and the visible Collection structure and Naruto subviews.
Open: post-round results, alternate setups, setting domains/defaults, wider Reset effects,
retail button confirmation, support/Linked Mode windows, initial Practice values and content availability.
Observations have the image/save limits below; Collection and media coverage is partial.
Routine, field and data names come from `@annotations/NA2`; addresses are live.

This document owns observed menu behavior. Static constructors and routing
belong to [Mode flow](mode_flow.md), settings to
[Practice mode](../gameplay/modes/practice_mode.md), command IDs to
[Pause and restart control](../gameplay/session/pause_and_replay.md), and
selector states to [Character Select](character_select.md). Combat mechanics,
including substitution timing, defender control and incoming-definition
evidence, belong to [Substitution](../gameplay/characters/substitution.md)
and the other combat documents. Not every Mode Select entry is covered.

## Observation conditions

The recorded observations used an English-localized development image with
a loaded memory-card save; memory-card writes were discarded. They remain
conditional on the observed screens having retail behavior, which was not
verified screen by screen. Image-dependent observations were removed.
The English labels below describe the observed image; retail labels are
Japanese. Stage and Collection lists record entries and order, not their
availability at particular retail progress states, because the save was not
retail evidence.

Button assignments are grounded in static retail evidence. The command-ID
joins come from the linked owners and were not independently re-derived by
the navigation observations; menu and battle code were not exhaustively
inspected. The Mode Select loop, every Practice pause entry, both Free Battle
pause variants and every Options root entry were visited. Collection covered
its three roots, Naruto's visible categories and the visible Movie/Music
lists, rather than every character or item.

Each observation is a freshly rendered frame after a complete DualShock 2
state was applied for an exact number of frames.

Menu transitions impose an input lock. A button state sent before the next
menu becomes interactive can be ignored even though the transition has
finished visually. Findings below therefore come only from a visible response
or a stable post-input frame.

## Common menu controls

Retail menu handlers accept with Circle and back out with Cross
(`mode_select_decode_direct_input`, resident `0x00384CD0`); see
[Mode Select input actions](mode_flow.md#input-actions) and the
[menu-input handler map](../runtime/menu_input/README.md). This document
therefore names those actions Confirm and Back.

| Input | Observed behavior |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad Up/Down | Move between vertical menu entries. Mode Select wraps from the last entry to the first. |
| Confirm | Confirm the highlighted entry or setting. |
| Back | Back on ordinary menus; labelled Cancel on Screen Settings. |
| Start | Save from Mode Select. |
| Select | Restore defaults on Control, Screen, and Music Settings. |
| L1/R1 | Move between pages in the Collection character grid; zoom the model in/out in the Figure viewer. |

## Mode Select

The in-scope entries appear in this physical order:

1. Free Battle
2. Practice
3. Collection
4. Options

Repeated Down presses moved through the entries and wrapped from the last one
back to the first. The footer labels Start as the save action.

| Mode | Observed behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Free Battle | Opens character/team selection, Stage Select, battle setup, and a standard timed round. Both 1P-versus-COM and joined-Player-2 paths were entered. |
| Practice | The visible description presents it as the place to practice basic controls and other techniques. It opens a 1P-versus-COM character selector. |
| Collection | Opens the acquired-content browser described below. |
| Options | Opens difficulty, controller, screen, audio, and reset settings. |

Practice remained accessible after the return transition: a two-frame Confirm
state was missed and an eight-frame Confirm state was accepted. A sampling
miss is an inference from that observation; its precise cause is unresolved.

Resident callback IDs, overlay handoffs, unlock-driven physical-slot
construction, and the complete result table are owned by
[`mode_flow.md`](mode_flow.md#mode-select-result-table). This document owns
only the visible runtime navigation and loaded-state behavior.

## Free Battle setup

Free Battle opens a split character selector similar to Practice, with Player
1 on the left and COM on the right. The right side additionally displays
`Press START button to join in!`. Pressing Start on controller slot 1
changes the right-side role from `COM` to `2P` in place; it does not restart
or leave character select. The footer provides Select Color on L1, Random, OK,
and Back. `character_selector_handle_fighter_input` (resident `0x003B5DF0`)
assigns Random to Triangle; see
[Selection state machine](character_select.md#selection-state-machine).

The 1P-versus-COM path uses the same four team selections as Practice: Player
1 main character, Player 1 linked character, COM main character, then COM
linked character. Naruto was initially selected as both main characters.

After both teams are confirmed, Free Battle opens Stage Select. The initial
selection was `Hidden Leaf Village`, numbered `1/24`. The screen is a vertical
stage carousel and advertises Random, OK, and Back.

Confirming the stage opens a `Round 1` versus screen. It shows the complete
teams and a 0-win/0-loss counter for each side. The joined branch labels the
two sides `1P` and `2P`. Square opens Battle Settings; the screen also offers
Customize Jutsu, OK to start the round, and Back.

In 1P-versus-COM, Player 1's confirmation starts the round. In the joined
branch, each controller must confirm independently: Player 1's confirmation
placed a `Battle!` ready marker only on the left, and 1,200 neutral frames did
not advance the screen; Player 2's confirmation then allowed the battle
transition to begin.

### Battle Settings

The loaded Battle Settings values were:

| Row | Loaded value |
| --- | --- |
| Time | 99 |
| Difficulty | Normal |
| Items | Normal |
| Chakra | Normal |
| Ultimate Jutsu | Command |
| Handicap | Balanced: five markers on each side |

Select is labelled `Return to Defaults`; Confirm accepts and Back backs out.
No value was changed.

### Customize Jutsu

Customize Jutsu overlays Player 1's two special-move slots on the versus
screen. Naruto's loaded Jutsu 1 was `Naruto Uzumaki Combo Attack`; Jutsu 2 was
`Great Ball Rasengan`. The overlay also displays each slot's
directional-plus-Circle command glyph and horizontal selection arrows. No
selection was changed.

The setup sequence is therefore as follows. In the retail selector, each
linked-character confirmation is followed by a Linked Mode window before that
side is finalized; see
[Selection state machine](character_select.md#selection-state-machine).

```text
Mode Select
  -> 1P main character
  -> 1P linked character
  -> COM main character
  -> COM linked character
  -> Stage Select
  -> Round versus screen / optional Battle Settings and Customize Jutsu
  -> battle
```

The joined branch confirms both main characters together, then both linked
characters together, before the same Stage Select. Its versus screen waits for
both players' independent ready confirmations:

```text
Mode Select
  -> joined 1P/2P main-character selection
  -> joined 1P/2P linked-character selection
  -> Stage Select
  -> Round versus screen / both players ready
  -> battle
```

### Free Battle round and pause menu

The observed round loaded Hidden Leaf Village with the standard battle HUD and
a countdown that began at 99. The Normal COM attacked during neutral frame
advance, producing the ordinary hit counter and reducing Player 1's health.

Start opens this six-entry menu in 1P-versus-COM:

| Command ID | Visible entry | Runtime behavior |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0` | Controls | Opens Control Settings. |
| `2` or `3` | 1P Commands | Opens Player 1's character-specific move list. |
| `1` | Command Chart | Opens the generic battle-control reference. |
| `6` | Simple Display | Opens the instructional-display On/Off selector. |
| `0xA` | Back to Game Mode Screen | Opens a Yes/No dialog asking to quit Battle and return to Game Mode Select. |
| `0xB` | Back to Character Select | Returns toward Free Battle character selection after confirmation. |

In a joined-Player-2 round, the menu inserts `2P Commands` immediately after
`1P Commands`, producing seven entries while leaving the remaining order
unchanged. `start_menu_build_commands` (`BTL.BIN`, `0x0087B3B0`) owns the
optional entry and the placeholder replacement recorded in its annotation;
the resulting command identities are described in
[Command identities and observed labels](../gameplay/session/pause_and_replay.md#command-identities-and-observed-labels).

The Game Mode exit dialog initially selects `Yes`.

## Practice setup

Practice first opens a split `Select Character` screen with Player 1 on the
left and a COM opponent on the right. Both sides initially selected Naruto in
the observed state. Each side also has a visible Ultimate Jutsu slot. The
footer advertises Select Color on L1, Random, OK, and Back.

The confirmation path then proceeds in this order:

1. Confirm Player 1's main character. The left panel changes to
   `Linked Character`.
2. Finalize Player 1's linked character. The left team displays `Battle!` and
   focus moves to the COM main-character grid.
3. Confirm the COM main character. The right panel changes to its
   `Linked Character` selection.
4. Finalize the COM linked character. A versus confirmation screen shows both
   complete teams.

The versus confirmation screen advertises Square for `Practice Settings`, OK,
and Back.

### Practice Settings runtime view

Square opens a 17-row Practice Settings overlay. With Status at `Stand`, the
static default, rows were presented as follows:

| Section | Row | Runtime presentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Player/general | Health | Active |
| Player/general | Chakra | Active |
| Player/general | Linked Attack | Active; this is the Link Gauge control, not the opponent row below |
| Player/general | Ultimate Jutsu | Active |
| Player/general | Linked Mode | Active |
| Player/general | Items | Active |
| Player/general | Commands | Active |
| Player/general | Damage | Active |
| Player/general | Guide Ninja Sound | Active |
| Opponent Settings | Status | Active |
| Opponent Settings | Strength | Dimmed while Status is Stand |
| Opponent Settings | Attack | Active |
| Opponent Settings | Guard | Active |
| Opponent Settings | Move | Active |
| Opponent Settings | Substitution Jutsu | Dimmed while Status is Stand |
| Opponent Settings | Linked Attack | Active |
| Opponent Settings | Extra Hit Counter | Active |

At `Status: Stand`, the UI therefore exposes Attack, Guard, Move, Linked
Attack, and Extra Hit Counter while visibly disabling Strength and
Substitution Jutsu. The row order and availability agree with the static
controller map in
[`practice_mode.md`](../gameplay/modes/practice_mode.md#rows-local-values-and-manager-storage),
which also records each row's values and Defaults.

Select is labelled `Return to Defaults`; Confirm accepts the settings and Back
backs out. No value was changed.

### Entering the Practice battle

Confirm accepted the unchanged settings and returned to the team-versus
screen. Confirming that screen did **not** open a stage selector. It
immediately entered the `Start Battle` transition and loaded a training-field
arena.

The first stable playable frame shows:

- Player 1 Naruto on the left and COM Naruto on the right;
- both health bars full;
- an infinity symbol in place of a round timer;
- the standard character names and bottom item selectors;
- the training field with wooden posts and target dummies in the background.

Thus the Practice path is:

```text
Mode Select
  -> 1P main character
  -> 1P linked character
  -> COM main character
  -> COM linked character
  -> team-versus confirmation / optional Practice Settings
  -> Start Battle transition
  -> training-field battle (no stage-choice screen observed)
```

### Practice pause menu

Start opens a seven-entry pause menu. Joining the visible order to the
Practice command-ID sequence established statically in
[`pause_and_replay.md`](../gameplay/session/pause_and_replay.md) gives this map:

| Command ID | Visible entry | Runtime behavior |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0` | Controls | Opens the same two-player Control Settings/remapping screen used by Options. |
| `2` or `3` | 1P Commands | Opens the active Player 1 character's scrollable move notation. For Naruto, the first visible moves were Flying Shadow Rising Attack, Charging Kick, and Clone Jutsu: Head Split. |
| `1` | Command Chart | Opens a generic battle-control reference. It notes that Manual linked attacks require pressing Linked Attack again after the linked move to attack. |
| `6` | Simple Display | Opens an On/Off selector with On initially selected; see [Simple Display selection](../gameplay/session/pause_and_replay.md#simple-display-selection). Its description says it displays the game's special controls. |
| `5` | Practice | Reopens the live 17-row Practice Settings editor. |
| `0xA` | Back to Game Mode Screen | Opens a Yes/No dialog asking to quit Practice and return to Game Mode Select. |
| `0xB` | Back to Character Select | Opens a Yes/No dialog asking to quit Practice and return to Character Select. |

Both exit dialogs initially select `Yes`; Back cancels them.

## Options

The Options root contains:

```text
             Difficulty Settings
       Control Settings   Screen Settings
       Music Settings     Reset
```

Difficulty spans the top of the panel; the other four entries form a
two-by-two directional grid.

### Difficulty

Confirm enters difficulty editing and displays horizontal arrows. Moving Right
and Left in the loaded state established this ordered range:

```text
SIMPLE -> EASY -> NORMAL -> HARD -> INSANE
```

The left arrow is absent at `SIMPLE` and the right arrow is absent at `INSANE`;
additional inputs toward either endpoint did not change the value. A sixth,
Ultimate tier is gated by `SaveProfile.secondary.word_bank1[0x6A]` in
`difficulty_selector_update` (resident `0x0038BAC0`); see
[Progress gates](content_availability.md#progress-gates).

### Control Settings

The loaded save's mappings were:

| Action | Player 1 | Player 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack | Circle | Circle |
| Ultimate Jutsu Prep | Triangle | Triangle |
| Item Use | Square | Square |
| Jump | Cross | Cross |
| Guard | L1 and R1 | L2 and R2 |
| Item Select | L2 | L1 |
| Linked Attack | R2 | R1 |
| Vibration | On | On |

Player 2 matched the fixed native default, while Player 1 had a
shoulder-permuted assignment. The stored action arrays and their default are
documented in [Save data](save_data.md).

Confirm selects a button or item to change. Select restores the defaults, Back
returns, and Confirm accepts the page.

### Screen Settings

The page shows numeric `X` and `Y` screen-position offsets; both were `0` in
the loaded configuration. The D-pad adjusts position, Select restores the
default, Confirm accepts, and Back is labelled Cancel. No offsets were
changed.

The page is a modal `ScreenPositionView` (`0x24` bytes) that
`options_initialize` builds through `options_display_construct` from the loaded
`option.ccs`: two ordered controllers, three sprites and a panel at
`168,40` sized `176x88`. `options_enter_selected_submenu` copies
`SaveProfile.display_x/y` into the offsets and their staged copies and opens
the panel. `options_display_update` edits X by 3 within `-48..48` and Y by 1
within `-16..16` and applies each change live through `display_set_position`.
Confirm writes both offsets to the profile, Back restores the staged values,
and Select writes `0,0`; Confirm and Back end the modal.
`screen_position_present` draws it after the Options background, and
`options_display_destroy` releases it without writing the profile.

### Music Settings

The page exposes a volume control and an Output Mode selector. Output Mode was
`Stereo`; the alternate label shown by the control is `Mono`. The help text
states that the page changes music, sound-effect, and voice volume. Select
restores defaults, Confirm accepts, and Back returns. No audio setting was
changed.

### Reset

Reset acts immediately, without a confirmation dialog. After deliberately
changing Difficulty from `SIMPLE` to `HARD`, confirming Reset restored the
visible value to `NORMAL`; the help/status line reads
`Difficulty set to default.` This proves the Difficulty reset but does not
establish whether Reset also affects Control, Screen, or Music values.

## Collection

The Collection root has three entries:

1. Characters
2. Movie
3. Music

Confirm opens the highlighted category and Back returns.

### Characters

The character browser is a paged grid. L1 selects the previous page, R1 the
next page, Confirm opens a character, and Back returns. The first visible
page contained 16 entries:

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Naruto | Sakura | Sai | Kakashi |
| Neji | Lee | Tenten | Guy |
| Shikamaru | Choji | Ino | Asuma |
| Kiba | Shino | Hinata | Kurenai |

Opening Naruto displayed three categories:

- Figure
- Ultimate Jutsu
- Voice

Figure opens a 3D model viewer. L1 zooms in, R1 zooms out, the left stick moves
the model, the right stick rotates it, and Back returns. Naruto's viewer
also displayed the labels `Right!`, `Shadow Clone Jutsu`, and `Running Wild`.

The visible Naruto Ultimate Jutsu entries were:

- Great Ball Rasengan
- Overflowing Power
- Nine-Tail's Cloak
- Unchanging Relationship

Confirm is labelled `OK` for the highlighted entry and Back returns. The
selected entry was not opened.

The visible Naruto Voice entries were:

- Sadness and Rage
- Naruto's Determination
- Passion
- The Bond Between Us
- Reunion, and then...

Confirm plays the highlighted voice and Back returns.

### Movie

The visible Movie list contained:

1. Reunion Time I
2. Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons
3. People of Endless Darkness
4. Ninja Art: Beast Scroll Replicas
5. Fourth Awakened Mode
6. Reunion Time II
7. Credits

Confirm plays the highlighted movie and Back returns. Playback itself was not
exercised.

### Music

The visible portion of the Music jukebox contained:

1. Hidden Leaf Village
2. Hidden Leaf Gate
3. Five-Seal Barrier Cliff
4. Akatsuki Hideout
5. Foundation's Hideout
6. Tenchi Bridge

Confirm plays the highlighted track and Back returns. This is only the visible
portion of the list; the full track count and playback behavior were not
tested.

## Boundaries of current knowledge

- Alternate team/settings combinations, most setting value domains and
  Defaults actions, initial Practice settings values, and any Reset effects
  beyond Difficulty remain unestablished.
- The retail button assignments have not been confirmed by these
  observations, including the Free Battle Customize Jutsu button; the
  support-selection row and Linked Mode window were not observed.
- Free Battle is mapped through playable 1P-versus-COM and joined-Player-2
  Round 1 paths and both pause-menu variants. Post-round results remain
  untested.
- Practice is mapped through its versus confirmation, Practice Settings rows,
  first playable battle frame, and pause menu.
- Only the first visible character page, Naruto's visible detail lists, and the
  visible portions of Movie and Music were recorded. Collection completeness
  depends on save unlocks and was not established.
- No collection media was played and no Free Battle round was completed.
