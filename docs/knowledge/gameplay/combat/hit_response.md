# Battle hit-response state

## Research coverage

Established: the ordinary/guarded routing and its rejection gates, response
selection with callbacks and remaps, descriptors, animations and phase lengths,
the motion table and modifiers, gravity, the update order behind elapsed
counts, contact and held handoffs, input recoveries, timed downed recovery,
guarded transitions, rehit suppression, the rejection countdown, the
destination sets of all 74 table-selected source-response callbacks, and a
bounded raw-store, address-taken entry and callback-vector owner audit. Animation
roles are inferences from control flow. Open: stage-dependent timing of
grounded phases, visual confirmation of animation roles and move names,
non-default bindings, reachability of every callback branch, and
recovery-source pointer aliases. Arbitrary computed/bulk state writes and
callback-vector replacements remain outside the bounded audit.

The native battle state after a hit has been accepted in retail NA2
(`SLPS-25837`): ordinary reactions, table-driven motion, launch and contact
branches, downed recovery, and guarded reactions. Names describe demonstrated
control flow, not the game's own terminology.

Routines, structures and data are named by the NA2 annotations in
`@annotations/NA2`; their comments carry the per-routine detail. Addresses are
live.

Fighter fields are named in `Fighter`. Fields whose width is not established
keep raw offsets: `+0x9B8` (low two bits choose the grounded-family variant),
`+0xE3C` (hit request bits) and `+0xBA4` (an environment boundary).
*Grounded* means `contact_flags & 0x80`.

## Accepted-hit routing

`hit_route_accepted` sends a hit to `guard_enter_response` when
`guard_state >= 1` and to `response_enter_ordinary` otherwise. Attack flag
`0x00800000` can turn a guard into sentinel -1 (a facing condition) and
`0x00400000` clears it; both go ordinary. Sentinel -1 forces response `0x4F`
before any mapping or callback; a cleared guard uses normal selection
([Chakra and guard](chakra_and_guard.md#guarded-hit-selection-and-break-like-flags)).

Four router modes share that split with different gates:

| Mode | Request bit | Extra behavior |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `0x1` (paired fighter as source) | Can substitute a replacement record; rejected while `hit_rejection_active` or when `hit_expected_repeat` is zero |
| 1 | `0x4` | Requires a retained source with type halfword `0x474F` and word `+0x0C == 1` and an overlay admission (`hit_mode1_check`); runs the substitution check, then source callbacks |
| 2 | `0x8` | Requires a retained source and no rejection; substitution check; writes a paired marker (1 ordinary, -1 guarded, -2 intercepted), of which only 1 notifies |
| 3 | — | Requires a retained source and no rejection; plain split |

The substitution check is `input_match_trigger_binding`. A match diverts to
`hit_intercept` (code `0x21` for mode 1, `0x41` for mode 2), which clears the
action lock, damps both speeds, forces `(0,8)` and adjusts two private floats;
the hit then returns without a response. Record lookup is owned by
[Target selection](target_selection.md#retained-source-writers-and-record-lookup).

`hit_retain_source` can write recovery provenance and a pending combo count
([Combo accounting](combo_accounting.md#explicit-and-pending-updates)) without
creating a response; a retained recovery source therefore does not imply a new
response. Its record setup and damage belong to
[Damage](damage.md#all-fifteen-btl-source-retaining-calls). Its tail runs
`fighter_end_exchange` on both fighters.

## Ordinary response selection

`response_enter_ordinary` gets a substate from `response_select_substate` and
forces `(5, substate)`. The substate indexes both the descriptor table
(`action_descriptor_table`) and `response_motion_table`.

The authored selector is `ActionRecord.response_selector`. The
*grounded-family* column applies when `(+0x9B8 & 3) < 2` and the receiver is
grounded.

| Selector | Grounded family | Otherwise |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x00`, `0x01` | `0x27`, `0x28` | `0x2F` |
| `0x02`, `0x03` | `0x29`, `0x2A` | `0x30` |
| `0x04..0x07` | `0x2B..0x2E` | `0x31` |
| `0x08..0x0A` | `0x2F..0x31` | same |
| `0x0B..0x0E` | `0x32..0x35` | same |
| `0x0F` | `0x36` | `0x37` |
| `0x10`, `0x11` | `0x38`, `0x39` | same |
| `0x12` | `0x3C`/`0x3D` by orientation | same |
| `0x13..0x16` | `0x3E..0x41` | same |
| `0x17..0x1B` | `0x4A..0x4E` | same |
| `0x1C` | `0x50` | same |
| `0x1D..0x20` | `0x51/53/55/57` | `0x52/54/56/58` |
| `0x21` | `0x59` | same |
| `0x22..0x24` | random of `0x27/28`, `0x29/2A`, `0x2B/2C` | `0x2F`, `0x30`, `0x31` |
| `0x25` | random `0x27..0x2A` | random `0x2F..0x30` |
| `0x26` | random `0x29..0x2C` | random `0x30..0x31` |
| `0x27` | random `0x27..0x2C` | random `0x2F..0x31` |
| other | `0x27` | `0x2F` |

Authored use across the 74 primary tables (2,484 damaging records):

| Selector | Result | Records |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `0x00..0x07` | light `0x27..0x2E` / `0x2F..0x31` | 645 |
| `0x08..0x0A` | `0x2F..0x31` | 61 |
| `0x0B..0x0E` | `0x32..0x35` | 131 |
| `0x0F` | `0x36` / `0x37` | 95 |
| `0x10`, `0x11` | `0x38`, `0x39` | 135 |
| `0x12` | `0x3C` / `0x3D` | 490 |
| `0x13` / `0x14` / `0x15` / `0x16` | `0x3E` / `0x3F` / `0x40` / `0x41` | 24 / 390 / 433 / 22 |
| `0x17..0x19` | held `0x4A..0x4C` | 10 |
| `0x1C` | `0x50` | 2 |
| `0x1D`, `0x1E` | `0x51..0x54` | 46 |

The random selectors are unused by damaging records; the 300 records with
selector `0xFF` are non-damaging. `guard_selector` is 0..4 on 2,311 damaging
records and 6..9 on 173.

Selection order around that mapping:

1. Guard sentinel → `0x4F`; missing record → `0x27`; failed context query →
   `0x3A`/`0x3B`.
2. An attack with a nonzero `row` against a falling `(5,0x3F)` receiver with
   no rejection count gives `0x37` under an environment-boundary test.
3. The source's character callback (below) replaces the mapping unless it
   returns -1.
4. Without a callback result, a repeat collapse applies for non-jutsu attacks
   with an expected repeat above 1 (`0x52/54/56/58` exempt):

   | Authored | Collapsed |
   | --- | --- |
   | `0x37`, `0x32` | `0x30` |
   | `0x3F` | `0x32` |
   | `0x40/0x41` | `0x2C` grounded family, else `0x35` |
   | `0x3C..0x3E` | `0x2B` grounded family with grounded source, `0x35` with airborne source, else `0x30` |
   | `0x36`, `0x38`, `0x39`, `0x4A..0x50` | random `0x29/0x2A` if grounded, else `0x30` |

5. Streak checks: `response_streak` counts consecutive responses to the same
   record at its expected repeat. A provisional `0x2F` becomes `0x37` when the
   expected repeat is below 2, the streak exceeds 2 and the source is
   grounded; any result becomes `0x37` for a grounded receiver with a streak
   above 3 and a zero `streak_exempt`. `response_exit_cleanup` resets the
   streak when leaving major 5.
6. With effect 0 or 1 attached, an airborne receiver keeps only `0x36..0x49`,
   `0x51..0x58` or `0x5A`; others become `0x37`.

`response_apply_table_timing` overrides the result with `0x5B` (grounded) or
`0x5C` and zero speeds for a jutsu-category attack when
`status_flags & 0x01` is clear and `opponent_lock_override` is zero.

`0x3A`/`0x3B` increment `response_repeat_count` up to 3; at 3 the receiver's
rejection count is primed to 60 if nothing is pending. The downed handoff
scale `1.0 - 0.25 * response_repeat_count` therefore steps through 0.75, 0.50
and 0.25. For an attack `rejection_count` of `0x7FFF`, event 0 stages the
row's lock value (6 for `0x3A`, 8 for `0x3B`) as the rejection count. With
receiver rate `r` and paired rate `p`, it multiplies by `2 - r` when `r != 1`,
again by `2 - r` when `p > 1`, and by `2 - p` when `p < 1`; the asymmetry is in
the code.

No static evidence justifies names such as "stagger", "crumple" or "guard
crush" for any substate.

### Character callbacks

Each source character's `<character>_hit_response(source, receiver, mode)`
can replace the response; -1 keeps the generic result. The receiver-side
lookup `receiver_vector_predicate` always returns zero, so the source's
callback is used. The initializer calls it in mode 2; `hit_classify_pair`
calls it in mode 0 earlier. Most motion writes are gated on mode 2, but live
attack-record writes are not, so the mode-0 call is not read-only.

`hit_repeat_value` is the repeat value callbacks compare: the receiver's
expected repeat when the source's current record is the retained one,
otherwise that record's `repeat_count`.

All 74 primary characters have a callback (annotated by character). First
Hokage's returns -1; Second Stage Kidomaru's returns -1 after the repeat query;
Sakura's and Ino's always return -1 but change motion or record fields. The
other 70 have non-default branches, so authored selector counts do not
describe final reactions. Examples that matter for the shared machine:

- Fourth Awakened Naruto, action `0x28`: `0x40`, then random reactions when
  grounded; rewrites the record's repeat, pause and rejection values.
- Rock Lee action `0x18` phase 3 and Might Guy action `0x1C` phase 3 write
  rejection count `0x7FFF`, so the row's count applies.
- Loopy Fist Lee action `0x1B` selects held `0x4A` without an authored held
  selector.
- Hanabi action `0x18` writes `attack_scale` in both modes.

The callbacks write `attack_scale`, `planar_scale` and `vertical_scale`,
consumed by the response motion. Response choice can therefore change with
phase, repeat value, grounding, private fields and randomness, and can move a
hit into or out of the states that the recovery and contact rules below
accept.

### Source-callback destination coverage

The bounded source set is `character_definition_table` (`0x005A2900`): 94
eight-byte rows, including row 0 with null pointers and 78 distinct nonnull
definitions. Each definition stores its callback vector at `+0x1C`; slot 3
at vector `+0x0C` is the source response. The 74 dedicated definitions select
74 distinct nonzero response callbacks. Auxiliary definitions 26/29/30/31
have a null response slot; repeated filler rows reuse Classic Naruto's
definition. Each callback's annotation records its complete static result set.

**Observed:** across those 74 callbacks, the result union is `-1`,
`0x27..0x2C`, `0x2F..0x36`, `0x38/0x39`, `0x3C..0x41`,
`0x4A/0x4C/0x4F`, and `0x51/0x52`. None returns a contact destination
`0x42..0x49`, `0x5A..0x62`, or another non-sentinel value outside ordinary
`0x27..0x5C`. This closes callback-result entry into `0x48/0x49` for the
bounded set; it does not constrain the generic selector or later transitions.

Return-contributing dependencies were included: `guy_response_delegate`
(`0x002C6380`) returns only `-1/0x39`; literal RNG bounds produce only the
recorded alternatives; Naruto, Taijutsu Chiyo and Shino load initialized
destination constants whose recorded xrefs are reads. Arbitrary indirect writes
to those constants remain outside this static result closure. Branch
reachability in ordinary play and callback-vector replacement outside the
table-selected owners are not established.

The `0x4A/0x4C/0x4F/0x51/0x52` branches select receiver responses.
Numeric action IDs below are callback-local, and repeat means
`hit_repeat_value`:

| Character / annotated callback | Exceptional destination and condition |
| --- | --- |
| Loopy Fist Lee / `lee_loopy_hit_response`, `0x00284FE0` | `0x4A`: action `0x1B`, phase 0. |
| The Yellow Flash / `yellow_flash_hit_response`, `0x00278310` | `0x4C`: action `0x28`, repeat below 2. `0x51/0x52`: action `0x1B`, phase 2, repeat below 2, grounded/airborne receiver. |
| Anko Mitarashi / `anko_hit_response`, `0x0027E4F0` | `0x4C`: action `0x18`, repeat 2. |
| Possessed Gaara / `gaara_possessed_hit_response`, `0x002860D0` | `0x4C`: action `0x23`, phase 0. |
| Second Stage Sakon / `sakon_stage2_hit_response`, `0x00293C50` | `0x4C`: action `0x24`, repeat at least 2. |
| Yamato / `yamato_hit_response`, `0x002FCA90` | `0x4F`: action `0x1F`, signed first halfword of the counter pointed to by source `+0x5AB0` equals 1 after the accumulator call. |
| Sai / `sai_hit_response`, `0x002FEF00` | `0x4F`: action `0x1E`, signed first halfword of the counter pointed to by source `+0x5300` equals 1 after the accumulator call. |
| Kankuro (Classic) / `kankuro_classic_hit_response`, `0x0026B5D0` | `0x51`: action `0x1B`, repeat below 2. |
| The Third Hokage / `third_hokage_hit_response`, `0x0026F000` | `0x51`: action `0x18` or `0x22`, repeat at least 2, grounded receiver, RNG `0..3` result 3. |
| Kankuro / `kankuro_hit_response`, `0x002A47B0` | `0x51`: action `0x22`. |
| Granny Chiyo / `chiyo_hit_response`, `0x002AE680` | `0x51`: action `0x1C`, phase 8, grounded receiver; overrides the earlier light/random choice. |
| Kisame Hoshigaki / `kisame_hit_response`, `0x002CDA90` | `0x51`: action `0x1E`, repeat 1. |
| Granny Chiyo (Taijutsu) / `chiyo_taijutsu_hit_response`, `0x002DA970` | `0x51`: action `0x3D`. |
| Kurenai Yuhi / `kurenai_hit_response`, `0x002F37A0` | `0x51`: action `0x1E`, repeat 1; or action `0x19`, repeat 1, or repeat 2 with source effect `0x5B/0x5C`. |

At `response_select_substate`'s callback call (`0x00232464`), a result other
than `-1` skips generic repeat collapse but still passes the later streak and
effect remaps. `response_enter_ordinary` calls the selector in mode 2 and
commits `(5, result)` at `0x00232D1C`. The result is not a requested major
state or a call to `recovery0_enter`/`recovery1_enter`.

Shared requested-state preparation is `response_prepare_entry`
(`0x002308D0`). Its explicit `0x42..0x49` classifier invokes
`response_contact_enter` before the new state is installed. A requested
`0x42..0x49` entry through this preparation runs contact-entry setup,
including its gated contact damage, without calling the automatic proposal;
the proposal's chakra decision is separate. None of the
bounded callbacks supplies such a contact destination. Their chosen launch,
motion and live attack-record flags can still change later contact eligibility.
The attacker's own count-0 recovery calls and Loopy Fist Lee's own downed exit
remain separate [entry families](#recovery-decision-boundaries).

## Phases, animations and lengths

Each descriptor lists `PhaseRecord`s whose conditions are owned by
[Combat action execution](combat_action_execution.md#shared-phase-progression).
Notation: `E` animation end, `G` grounded, `D` falling or grounded, `O` end or
grounded, `B` end and grounded, `C<n>` secondary cursor `n`, `H` held
(condition 0), `T` end of list.

| `E, T` | `0x3A/0x3B`, `0x45/0x46`, `0x4F`, `0x51/0x53/0x55/0x57`, `0x5B` |

| `C3, G, E, T` | `0x48/0x49` |
| `H, T` | `0x4A..0x4E`, `0x50` |
| `O, G, E, T` | `0x5A` |
| `C4, C6, G, E, T` | `0x5C` |

| Recovery substate | Phases | Rate |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x5D` | `H, T` | — |
| `0x5E` | `G, T` | phase 0: 1.5 |
| `0x5F` | `D, T` | — |
| `0x60` | `C3, T` | phase 0: 2.0 |
| `0x61` | `E, H, T` | — |
| `0x62` | `G, E, H, T` | — |

Non-default phase rates in `0x27..0x5C`: `0x29/0x2A` phases 0/1 0.9375;
`0x2B/0x2C` 0.875; `0x2D` 0.6875; `0x2E` phases 0/1 and `0x3B` phase 0 0.75;
`0x32..0x35` phase 1, `0x3E` phase 1 2.0; `0x5A` phase 0 0.25; `0x5B` phase 0
1.5.

Hitstun is therefore not one counter: phases end on animation, contact or
timeline conditions, and held rows need external progression.

### Animation-gated lengths

Animation slots resolve through the character's `ANM_` names
(`CMN/2CMNBOD1.CCS` for `pcmn` names, otherwise the character's
`PL/2???BOD1.CCS`). An animation with frame count `F`, start frame `S` (1 when
the rate is below 256 and `S` is 0) and rate `R` ends after
`n = max(1, ceil((F - 1 - S) * 256 / R))` unpaused updates at update rate 1.0;
a `C<k>` phase lasts `ceil(k * 256 / R)` updates. Within one update the phase
updater reads the previous animation result, the dispatcher selects the
phase's animation, and the animation pass advances it, so an `E` phase lasts
exactly `n` updates. A state entered by hit routing cannot consume the
previous animation's end: the routed-this-update contact bit blocks the phase
updater until the animation pass.

Counts across all 74 primary characters (minimum..maximum, median); `G` and
`D` end on physics, `O` ends no later than `n`, `B` no earlier:

Hiruko uses `htn0`/`hxn0` where others use `htn4`/`hxn4`, and Hiruko and
Classic Kankuro use `jmp0`/`jmp3` where others use `jpz1`. A median grounded
light hit `0x27` takes about 10 unpaused updates. **Inference:** `htn`/`hxn`
are the hit and recovery halves of light reactions and `col` is the collapse;
these are resource names, not visual confirmation.

Recovery animations: `kno0` for `0x5D`, `jmp2` for `0x5E..0x60`, `col0` then
`kno0` for `0x61`, and `dow0`, `lan0`, `nut0` for `0x62`. `0x60` completes after
2 updates and `0x61`'s `col0` phase after 8.

## Response motion

`response_motion_table` has one `ResponseMotionRow` per substate
`0x27..0x5C`. `response_update_ordinary` runs `response_motion_update` every
action update: on the update where the primary timeline crosses the row's
event gate it writes both speeds and saves `attack_scale`; on every other
update it damps planar speed toward zero. The pause value is applied by a
separate event test, which uses event 0 instead of the row's gate while an
exchange role is set.

`R` replaces both speeds, `A` adds them; rows are merged only when identical.

### Modifiers

The table holds bases. At the motion event, in order:

1. Planar speed is clamped to the character's grounded or airborne limit and
   airborne vertical speed to the character table's lower bound.
2. One of: a source `fighter_knockback_scalar` `s != 1` (planar × `s`,
   vertical × `1 + 0.5(s - 1)`); otherwise ×1.25 on both in major 5 with a
   high exchange role; otherwise the source's `knockback_given` with the same
   form, then the receiver's `knockback_taken` `q` clamped to 0..2 (planar ×
   `1 - 0.75(q - 1)`, vertical × `1 - 0.25(q - 1)`).
3. `attack_scale` `s`: planar × `s`; vertical × `1 + 0.5(|s| - 1)` above 1,
   otherwise × `|s|` (or the half-strength form with a source scalar below 1).
4. `planar_scale` and `vertical_scale`. Each consumed transient resets to 1.0.

`attack_scale` comes from `ActionRecord.knockback_scale` when
`response_retain_attack_record` (or the Extra Hit retarget) retains a new
record with a nonzero repeat count. Authored scales: 1.0 on 1,859 damaging
records; above 1 on 423 (1.5 ×154, 1.25 ×149, 1.2 ×37, 2.0 ×33, others up to
3.0); below 1 on 200 (down to 0.0); `-0.5` and `-2.0` once each, which reverse
the planar direction.

### Gravity

In major 5, with an exchange role, or with `state_flags & 0x80`, the movement
pass applies a fixed gravity of `3.0 × update_rate` per update with terminal
speed -90; other states use the character gravity
([Movement and physics](../stages/movement_and_physics.md#gravity-and-input-smoothing)).
The row's aux value only removes the -90 clamp when it is not 1.0.

The launch is written in the hit update and the first movement follows in the
same update, so a launch with final vertical speed `v > 0` starts falling (a
`D` phase) after `floor(v / 3) + 1` active updates. **Inference:** on flat
ground it lands after about `2v/3 + 1` updates (14–15 for `0x3C/0x3D`, about
38 for `0x3F`); stage geometry decides the exact contact. Pause updates add to
these counts.

## Pause, lock and update order

Two countdowns run in order:

1. `update_pause` decrements by 1.0. While positive, action timelines,
   the per-action dispatcher, movement and animation stop; the displayed
   position jitters. This is the hitstop.
2. `action_lock` decrements by `update_rate`, only once the pause is
   below 1. `action_entry_allowed` refuses entry while it is nonzero.

Staged values are written as `-N` with a pending flag and become `N` on the
next maintenance pass without decrementing
([Timer primitives](../../runtime/timer_primitives.md#fractional-integer-cursor-block)).

Pause sources:

- the attack `update_pause` at initialization: positive staged, negative
  active immediately, zero clears but leaves the pending flag, `0x7FFF`
  untouched;
- the row pause at its event, only when nothing is pending, so a positive or
  zero attack pause suppresses a gate-0 row pause.

The row lock applies at event 0. When it raises the lock, the absolute attack
pause is added (unless `0x7FFF`); category `0x2` forces 20; jutsu and
hold/companion categories bypass the row minimum.

Within one 30 Hz battle update ([Battle lifecycle](../session/battle_lifecycle.md#battle-update-cadence)),
`battle_dispatch_phases` calls `fighters_phase_slot_0c` (running
`fighters_update`, then each fighter's movement/animation slot), then
`fighters_phase_slot_14` (each fighter's timeline slot). `fighters_update`
runs:

1. countdown maintenance for every fighter;
2. pair helpers and `hit_resolve_pair`, then the hit requests: `0x100`
   `hit_attacker_landed`, `0x1` mode 0, `0x8` mode 2, `0x4` mode 1;
3. removals;
4. for fighters with no active pause: bridge, `fighter_pre_phase_step`,
   `fighter_update_phase_and_exits`, `fighter_consume_logical_input`,
   `fighter_dispatch_action_update`;
5. request `0x2` (`hit_handle_bit2`).

Because routing precedes the per-action pass, event 0 of a new response runs
in the hit update unless a pause is already active. With a positive attack
pause `N`, update rates 1.0 and nothing pending:

| Update | Receiver |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | hit routed; response entered; pause staged; event 0 runs motion, damage ([Damage](damage.md)), lock and rejection staging; first movement and animation step |
| 1 | lock decrements once, then the pause activates at `N` |
| 2..N | suspended; the lock does not decrement |
| N+1 | pause reaches 0; action updates resume |

The receiver is suspended for exactly `N` updates after the hit update. With
row lock `L`, the lock reaches zero in update `2N + L`. A negative attack
pause `-N` freezes updates `0..N-1` and runs event 0 in update `N`. Update
rate scales the lock and timelines but not the pause.

During the pause the movement slot still runs the bridge, action selection
and the guard-input age, so a candidate such as an Extra Hit counter can be
chosen.

The attacker's pause comes from request `0x100` (`hit_attacker_landed`):
when the defender's rejection count is not positive and the attack has category
`0x2` or a nonzero expected repeat, the attack pause is applied immediately
(none for category `0x2`), so the attacker is suspended in updates `0..N-1`. Flag `0x20000` skips it
(151 records, 138 damaging); `0x7FFF` uses the defender's selected response or
guard row pause.

Authored `update_pause` on damaging records: 2 (914), 3 (415), 1 (271), 4
(194), 5 (86), `0x7FFF` (477), 0 (44), negative (66), 6..16 (17).

`action_entry_allowed` keeps `0x27..0x5A` ineligible after the lock ends;
`0x5B/0x5C` are eligible at once, and mode 2 bypasses the rejection. In major
6, `0x5F` is eligible from cursor 8 and `0x60` from cursor 3; others are not.

## Response exits

`response_dispatch_transition` receives the phase-completion signal
(`phase_event_completion`):

| Substate | Exit |
| --- | --- |
| `0x27..0x2E` | neutral `(0,0)` |
| `0x2F..0x31` | `(4,0x26)` grounded, else `(3,0x1E)` |
| `0x32..0x35` | `(4,0x26)` grounded, else `(3,0x25)` |
| `0x36..0x39`, `0x42..0x49`, `0x51..0x58` | downed handoff, scale 1.0 |
| `0x3A/0x3B` | downed handoff, scale `1 - 0.25 × response_repeat_count` |
| `0x3C..0x41` | downed handoff, then the contact checks below |
| `0x4A..0x4E` | `response_held_handoff` every update |
| `0x4F` | neutral under the two conditions below |
| `0x50` | neutral once the paired fighter leaves major 8 |
| `0x59` | primary event 1 calls `fighter_paired_event`; completion does nothing |
| `0x5A` | forced to phase 2 when grounded below it; completion hands off to downed |
| `0x5B` | `(8,0x14)` if either fighter's `+0xB10` is set, else neutral |
| `0x5C` | the same, else neutral grounded or `(3,0x1E)` |

Held `0x4A..0x4E` follow the paired fighter:

| Paired fighter | Held fighter |
| --- | --- |
| not in major 8 with a record, paired in `(6,0x61/0x62)` | `(6,0x61)` |
| not in major 8 with a record, otherwise | `(2,0x1D)`, restoring `saved_response_position` unless the paired action keeps it |
| action flag `0x04000000` | stays |
| category `0x100`, event bit `0x2` clear / set | neutral / stays |
| categories `0x100` and `0x200` clear | neutral |
| `0x200` only, event bit `0x8` set / clear | re-enters an ordinary response / stays |

These are paired synchronization, not hitstun timers
([Throws and captures](throws_and_captures.md#common-entry-handoff-and-interruption)).

`0x4F` runs `response_4f_rate_sequence`: event 0 sets both fighters'
`update_rate_override` to 0.1, then after six invocations eases both back to
1.0 over six more, reaching stage 3 on the thirteenth unpaused call. `0x4F`
exits to neutral when the paired fighter executes a jutsu-category action
(this also clears the lock), or when its animation is complete and the stage
is 3.

### Contact rebounds

Before the state switch, `response_contact_proposal` can replace a launch
with a contact rebound (ordinary major 5, upward speed 40 at its event):

| Current and contact | Destination | Cursor ceiling |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `0x3C/0x3D/0x41`, side contact | `0x48` | 5 |
| `0x3E`, side contact, phase below 2 | `0x48` (attack scale 2.0) | none |
| `0x40/0x41`, grounded | `0x49` | 5 |

Grounding is tested last, so it wins for `0x41`. Every proposal needs a
retained attack, `saved_attack_scale > 0.5`, external mode 0, and flag
`0x80000` clear; then a cursor below the ceiling or flag `0x100000` (which an
exchange role also requires). `contact_consume_chakra` follows and can spend
the struck fighter's chakra ([Chakra and guard](chakra_and_guard.md)).
`response_contact_enter` turns the fighter for `0x48` and clears its repeat
count, or restores `attack_scale` for `0x49`. Both later hand off to downed.

Contact facts come from `fighter_apply_movement`, which refreshes the side,
grounded and ceiling bits each pass
([Movement and physics](../stages/movement_and_physics.md#floor-side-surfaces-and-limits)).

Authored: one record has `0x80000` (Classic Choji action 25) and 25 damaging
records have `0x100000`. Callback writers change them on the source's live
record: Rock Lee action `0x36` (by a private byte incremented on each mode-2
call, reset while the opponent leaves major 5), Deidara action `0x2C` (set
when the receiver's streak read before its increment is at least 3), and Might
Guy action `0x25` (`0x100000` by a chain byte owned by
[Substitution](../characters/substitution.md#callback-ordering-and-counter-ownership)).
Re-entering an attack or resetting a counter does not restore the shipped bits
(`fighter_enter_action_record` leaves flags alone). Deidara's action `0x2C`
also picks `0x41` with rejection `0x7FFF` while the repeat value is within 3 of
a per-chain baseline; action `0x2B` picks `0x3F` with `0x7FFF` below repeat 3.

Later in the switch:

| Current | Transition |
| --- | --- |
| `0x3C` / `0x3D` | airborne side contact → `0x42` / `0x43` |
| `0x3E` | side contact → `0x43` |
| `0x3F` | ceiling contact → `0x44` |
| `0x40` | on grounding: `0x46` if the cursor is below 4 and external mode is 0, else `0x45` with vertical speed `-0.5 × landing_vertical_speed` |
| `0x41` | on grounding → `0x47` |

The downed handoff in `0x3C..0x41` does not return, so a contact transition
can replace a downed state entered in the same dispatch; after the handoff the
cursor reads zero, so `0x40` can pick `0x46`. The `0x45` bounce normally reads
zero, because `response_exit_cleanup` clears `landing_vertical_speed` without
an exchange role.

Dispatch precedence: the first-grounded input recovery (below) runs before the
proposal, then the proposal, then the switch, the late input recovery, and a
final fallback. `0x3C..0x3E` with side contact first test a stage correction
(`stage_correct_position`) and return early when the position jumps by more
than 500. Initial `0x3C..0x41` skip all handling while exchange role bits
`0x1500` are set. The final fallback forces `(5,0x5A)` (except from `0x45` or
`0x5A`) when the environment boundary `+0xBA4` is unset or reached, a
side-contact exception does not apply, and `animation_slot` is `0x1E..0x22`
(`fxk2`, `col0`, `col1`, `col2`, `kno0`); it can replace an earlier
transition in the same dispatch.

### Input recoveries

Two binding-2 (`0x00010000`) recoveries run inside the ordinary response; they
are separate from the contact rebounds, downed choices and the Extra Hit
counter. `ACT_RCV_0/1` do not establish which one players call a rebound.

- **First grounded** (`ACT_RCV_1`, `(0,0x0A)`): substates `0x36..0x39`,
  `0x3C/0x3D`, `0x3F..0x41`, `0x48/0x49`; cursor at least 2; height above
  -500; not the dummy-drop record; no effect 0/1; exactly the first grounded
  update; no exchange role bits `0x1500` for `0x3C..0x41`. Enters through
  `recovery1_enter` and returns at once.
- **Late** (`ACT_RCV_0`, `(0,0x09)`): still in major 5 at `0x38/0x39`,
  `0x3C/0x3D`, `0x3F` or `0x48/0x49`; external mode 0; no pause; no exchange
  role; no effect 0/1; a retained `recovery_source` and `recovery_record`; the
  press not in the previous five stored samples (`input_history_has`); and the
  cursor inside:

  | Substate | Window |
  | --- | --- |
  | `0x38/0x39`, `0x48/0x49` | 4..6 |
  | `0x3C/0x3D` | 4..8, or `r+4..r+6` (`r` 0..3) for a standard source and category `0x200` |
  | `0x3F` | `r+3..r+5` (`r` 0..2) for a standard source, flag `0x2` and nonnegative vertical speed |

  Random windows are drawn on every query (`recovery_late_window`). The
  history ring is appended after the timelines and outside the pause guard,
  so five samples need not be five cursor updates.

`ACT_RCV_0` (`D, T`) exits to `(4,0x26)` grounded or `(3,0x24)`; its motion
(`recovery0_motion`) rises with `sqrt(2g × 250) - g/2`, `g = 3 × motion_scale`,
and clears a non-pending rejection count. `ACT_RCV_1` (`E, E, G, E, T`, phase
0 rate 2.0) exits to neutral grounded or `(3,0x1E)`, also as soon as it falls
without an exchange role; its motion uses `planar_scale` and
`vertical_scale`. Both player entries count statistic 12 unless
`status_flags & 0x01`; no resource is spent.

The effect 0/1 test (`fighter_has_effect_0_1`) checks only the struck
fighter's own list and ignores node countdowns, so a node awaiting removal
still blocks. Attacker-only effects do not count; IDs 0/1 install only on the
supplied fighter (`effect_apply`, `object_apply_effect1`). The same membership
drives the airborne `0x37` remap and Extra Hit candidate checks. Entering
`0x5D` or `0x61/0x62` requests their removal
([Battle items and status effects](../projectiles_and_items/battle_items_and_status_effects.md#update-expiry-and-removal)).

Other entries skip the ordinary response gates:

- `effect_7d_update` (`0x00304070`) can enter `ACT_RCV_0` after primary
  cursor 60, with `status_flags & 1` clear, no record returned by
  `fighter_action_record(-3)`, `context_state == 0`, and one of its listed
  major-5 substates (`0x37..0x39`, `0x3C/0x3D`, `0x3F..0x44`, `0x48/0x49`,
  `0x5A/0x5C`). It requires either a nonzero packed controller nibble or
  `BattleInput.logical_mask & 0x10000`. It clears rejection before calling
  `recovery0_enter` (`0x0022AAB0`), whose body counts statistic 12. It does
  not use the ordinary cursor window, five-sample history, or effect-0/1 gate.
- `attack_landing_recovery` (`0x0023F170`) enters `ACT_RCV_1` on grounded
  completion of a category-`0x200`/flag-`0x04000000` attack. Its call uses
  scales `1.0/1.0` and count `0`.
- `char_rcv1_callback_a` (`0x00287F50`) and `char_rcv1_callback_b`
  (`0x0026FAA0`) enter `ACT_RCV_1` from their own action `0x29`, phase 1,
  after secondary cursor 6. Both calls use planar scale `0.25`, vertical
  scale `0.5`, and count `0`, after clearing attack banks and restoring
  orientation. These three count-0 entries do not increment statistic 12.

`recovery_source`/`recovery_record` are retained provenance, not a fresh-hit
marker. `fighter_init` clears them; `response_enter_ordinary` and
`guard_enter_response` (non-jutsu attacks) write them for a source of type `0x474F` when
`status_flags & 0x01` is clear and `context_mode_word` is zero; a failed gate
keeps the old pair. `hit_enter_trade` and `hit_retain_source` also write
them. No response or recovery exit clears them; countdown maintenance and
`0x61`'s first event replace them with a self/`atk_dummy_record` pair. Copy
limits are owned by
[Target selection](target_selection.md#copied-provenance-and-pointer-lifetime-limits).

### Recovery decision boundaries

The resident dispatcher and helpers expose separate decisions. All addresses
below are live NA2 addresses; a shared animation destination does not establish
the same input requirement or entry side effects.

| Decision | Entry or decision address | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-grounded input recovery | `response_first_grounded_recovery_call`, `0x00233B68` | Calls `recovery1_enter`, then returns |
| Automatic side/floor proposal | `response_automatic_contact_proposal_call`, `0x00233B84`; helper `response_contact_proposal`, `0x002310F0` | Enters `(5,0x48/0x49)`, performs contact chakra handling, then returns |
| Later side/ceiling/floor reactions | Switch in `response_dispatch_transition`, `0x00233870` | Enters `(5,0x42..0x47)` under the contact rules above |
| Late input recovery | `response_late_recovery_window_call`, `0x00234450`; `response_late_recovery_entry_call`, `0x00234470` | Calls `recovery_late_window`, then directly enters `(0,0x09)` and performs its own lock/statistic bookkeeping |
| Timed downed choices | `downed_recovery_update`, `0x00235690` | Automatic `0x5E`, binding-2 `0x5F`, or binding-1 `0x60`, as described below |
| Effect-driven input/COM recovery | `effect_7d_update`, `0x00304070` | Independent `recovery0_enter` call under the gates above |
| Attack completion and character-local motion | `attack_landing_recovery`, `char_rcv1_callback_a/b` | Independent count-0 `recovery1_enter` calls under the gates above |
| Character-local downed entry | `lee_loopy_channel3`, `0x00283A70`; `lee_loopy_action22_downed_entry_call`, `0x00284A5C` | Own action `0x22`, phase 0, logical `0x10000`: clear attack banks and directly enter `(6,0x5F)` |
| Paired effect downed redirect | `effect_4a_callback`, `0x002C8690` | Under its effect-owner gates, paired substate `0x5D` outside major 8 becomes `(6,0x5F)` without the ordinary downed thresholds |
| Scripted contact-state assignment | `skill_blow_watch_late`, `0x0079D9A0`; call `0x0079DA0C` | Valid retained actor and selected ready byte directly enter `(5,0x43)` without the ordinary contact decision |

Loopy Fist Lee's action-`0x22` branch can also add logical `0x10000` itself:
when its AI behavior field is nonzero, distance is at least 500 and the primary
cursor is at least 37, RNG `0..6` result 1 supplies that command. Choices that
dispatch action `0x23` loop before the command check. This is the fighter's
own action exit, not a recovery opportunity in an ordinary hit response.
The paired effect's rate/removal behavior remains in
[Battle items and status effects](../projectiles_and_items/battle_items_and_status_effects.md#specialized-entry-exit-and-callback-behavior).

`recovery1_admission` (`0x0022ADD0`) exposes the broad first-grounded
eligibility conditions, but does not require the actual input, grounding or
`grounded_updates == 1`; a null `recovery_record` is allowed. The dispatcher
inlines the same broad check before its actual input/contact decision.
`recovery_late_admission` (`0x0022A760`) exposes the late path's major,
coordinator, pause, exchange, effect and substate gates. It does not check
input, cursor, history or the retained source/record pair.
`recovery_late_window` (`0x0022A890`) supplies those remaining checks.

The first-grounded and late entries are therefore not both calls to a common
recovery-entry routine. The automatic proposal does not require binding 2 and
does not scan effects 0/1. The later `0x42..0x47` contacts and major-6 choices
also have their own gates. `ACT_RCV_0/1`, contact recoil, downed recovery and
the Extra Hit exchange cannot be identified solely by the word "rebound".

The recovered direct `(0,0x09/0x0A)` state-setter calls are in the two entry
helpers and the dispatcher's inlined late entry; the inspected BTL direct
state-setter calls request neither pair. The
[source-callback destination audit](#source-callback-destination-coverage)
separately closes all 74 table-selected result sets without a contact/recovery
destination. Coverage includes the
dispatcher/helper graph, recovered direct helper callers and recovered direct
state-setter callers in the resident ELF and BTL. The additional writer and
callback-owner coverage is bounded below.

### Indirect and raw state writers

**Observed:** an explicit store-footprint audit across resident, BTL and ETC
loaded memory found 197 unique primary, instruction-aligned opcode-shaped
matches (107/89/1). Four are demonstrated Fighter state stores:

| Owner and annotated site | Stored value |
| --- | --- |
| `fighter_init_major_state_sentinel`, `0x00214CC0` | Signed halfword -1 to `major_state` (`+0x18E`) |
| `fighter_init_substate_sentinel`, `0x00214CC4` | Signed halfword -1 to `substate` (`+0x190`) |
| `fighter_store_major_state`, `0x00217EDC` | Common setter's requested major |
| `fighter_store_substate`, `0x00217F50` | Common setter's requested substate, unless it is -1 |

The initialization stores are construction/reset sentinels. The setter stores
publish entries after `fighter_action_exit` and
`fighter_prepare_action_state`; they are not additional recovery or contact
decisions. [Combat action execution](combat_action_execution.md#action-entry-and-state-ownership)
owns that entry ordering.

The footprint includes byte stores at `+0x18E..0x191`, halfwords at
`+0x18E/+0x190`, aligned word/FPU-word stores at `+0x18C/+0x190`,
doubleword/FPU-doubleword stores at `+0x188/+0x190`, quadword/COP2 stores at
`+0x180/+0x190`, and overlapping `SWL/SWR/SDL/SDR` footprints. The remaining
matches are stack or non-Fighter storage, or regular data rows. Genuine raw
code outside recovered function bodies includes IPU parsing context and fixed
GPR-save buffers; recognized BTL numeric initialization outside its declared
text range also uses stack temporaries. A segment or missing function alone
was not used to reject a writer.

Recovered `ADDIU/DADDIU` rebases at `+0x180/+0x188/+0x18C/+0x18E/+0x190`
and their signed inverses, plus adjacent `+0x182/+0x184/+0x186/+0x18A`,
produced no additional demonstrated Fighter state writer. These are selected
literal rebases, not a closure over arbitrary pointer arithmetic.

Address-taken entry searches found no literal pointer to
`fighter_set_action_state` (`0x00217E40`), `recovery0_enter` (`0x0022AAB0`)
or `recovery1_enter` (`0x0022AF10`), including their mapped uncached and
accelerated aliases, in the three programs' loaded memory. Recovered setter
xrefs are resident/BTL direct calls; ETC has none. Recovered aligned
low-immediate candidates resolve to other data/GP addresses, scalar loads or
unrelated instruction words rather than those entry pointers.

`fighter_publish_character_callbacks` (`0x00215238`) publishes the selected
record's `+0x1C` vector to Fighter `+0xA8`. A scoped literal word-store screen
in resident `0x00200000..0x00307FFF` found four sites, with this the only
demonstrated Fighter vector publication; the others use a puppet-trail node,
a separate `PL_DMY_OBJ` allocation, or the stack. Selected overlay stores and
explicit `+0xA8/+0x8C` rebases likewise supplied no demonstrated replacement.
`character_dispatch_provider_callbacks` (`0x00217728`) selects a provider's
record vector only for major 8, action 0..3 and a positive provider ID;
`character_dispatch_stored_callbacks` (`0x00217754`) uses the stored vector
otherwise. Provider selection changes that invocation's table and still passes
the original Fighter; it does not rewrite the stored vector. The
[execution callback contract](../characters/character_action_callbacks.md#static-scope)
owns the bounded class/slot census.

No additional rebound/contact entry family was established by this audit.
It does not exclude arithmetic-derived or interior function pointers,
other rebases/instruction forms, bulk copies, unrecovered pointer-forming
bodies, or writes through definition/vector-slot aliases and independently
constructed callback owners. The source-response result closure above remains
separate from those limits.

## Timed downed recovery

`downed_recovery_enter(scale, fighter)` enters `(6,0x5D)`. With
`state_flags & 0x08` it sets the thresholds:

| Profile | `downed_auto_recovery` | `downed_input_recovery` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `status_flags & 0x20` clear | 45 | 8 |
| set | 90 | 40 |

Both are multiplied by the scale (and an effect factor that is always 1.0 on
this path, since the call happens in major 5). The float-to-integer conversion
uses the active FPU rounding mode. Five overlay entries (`downed_override_a..e`)
instead force thresholds of 45 (or arguments) without setting the enable bit.

Update rate is 1.0 in majors 5 and 6 unless `update_rate_override` or
`update_rate_multiplier` is set, and the cursor starts at 0 on entry, so the
default profile recovers automatically in update 45 (1.5 s) and accepts input
from update 9; the slow profile uses 90 (3.0 s) and 41. `0x3A/0x3B` shorten
both. `paired_rate_sequence`, `exchange_rate_cleanup` and `effect_4a_callback`
also write those rate fields
([Battle items and status effects](../projectiles_and_items/battle_items_and_status_effects.md#specialized-entry-exit-and-callback-behavior));
effect `0x4A` can turn a paired `0x5D` into `0x5F` and redirect `0x61`.

`downed_recovery_update` for `0x5D`:

- enable bit clear: returns, no exit;
- airborne: two environment classes hold `0x5D`, others divert to `(5,0x5A)`;
- cursor ≥ `downed_auto_recovery` → `(6,0x5E)`; else cursor >
  `downed_input_recovery` with binding 2 → `(6,0x5F)`; then, only if the state
  did not change, binding 1 → `(6,0x60)`.

At default thresholds both inputs choose `0x5F` before the automatic exit.
`downed_first_event` primes the rejection count to 1 and clears the action
lock, yet `0x5D` stays ineligible for action entry. `0x5E` and `0x60` exit to
neutral and `0x5F` to `(3,0x20)`. `0x5E` rises with constant 125, `0x5F` with
250 and planar 20, `0x60` only turns.

`recovery_exit_cleanup` stages short rejection counts on leaving: 4 from
`0x5E`, 3 from `0x5F`, 2 from `0x60` (unless one is pending). It clears
`response_repeat_count` except toward `(5,0x3A/0x3B)`. The `0x5D` choices do
not test effects 0/1, contact flags or input history.

`action_rewrite_logical_mask` gives a recovery cancel: logical `0x00040000`
in `0x5E`, `0x60` and `0x5F` below cursor 3 forces `(0,0x0B)` (`ACT_BST_0`)
when `section` equals halfword `+0x324`, halfword `+0x9F0` is zero, the
fighter is in the grounded-family variant (`fighter_reaction_variant_high` is
zero) and no exchange role is set.

`0x61` (`H` after `col0`) moves on when external mode is set or the cursor
passes `0x13`: to `0x62` with the enable bit, otherwise through a dummy-record
ordinary response. `0x62` places the fighter at cursor `0x1E` from the stage's
`DMY_pp1_010`/`DMY_pp2_010` node (`stage_placement_section`,
[Stages](../stages/stages.md#resident-generic-factories-and-mandatory-records))
and returns to neutral after it when one of two fighter halfwords is zero.

## Guarded hits

Guard stance and the guard state consumed by the router are owned by
[Chakra and guard](chakra_and_guard.md#guard-input-and-action-lifecycle).

`guard_enter_response` takes `ActionRecord.guard_selector`, adds 5 to 0..4
when airborne, stores it in `guard_response_index`, and forces `(0,7)` for rows
5..9 or airborne and `(0,6)` otherwise. Descriptors: `(0,5)` `ACT_GDN_0`
(`nxg0`, held `gdn0`), `(0,6)` `ACT_GDN_1` (`ght0` 7..11, median 7; held
`gdn0`), `(0,7)` `ACT_GDA_1` (`gha0` 6..9, median 7; held `dow0`). The held
second phase is left only by `guard_update_stance`.

`guard_response_table`:

| Row | Planar | Vertical | Damping | Pause | Rejection | Lock | Phase rate |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 30 | 0 | 0.35 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 176 |
| 1 | 30 | 0 | 0.35 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 160 |
| 2 | 35 | 0 | 0.35 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 144 |
| 3 | 40 | 0 | 0.35 | 1 | 3 | 12 | 128 |
| 4 | 40 | 0 | 0.125 | 0 | 3 | 24 | 128 |
| 5 | 20 | 15 | 0.25 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 192 |
| 6 | 25 | 20 | 0.25 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 176 |
| 7 | 30 | 20 | 0.25 | 1 | 2 | 8 | 160 |
| 8 | 40 | 20 | 0.35 | 1 | 2 | 12 | 128 |
| 9 | 40 | 30 | 0.125 | 1 | 2 | 24 | 64 |

All rows replace speeds at event 0 with aux 1.0. `guard_response_init`
stages the rejection count unless the attack already did, raises the lock to
the row value, and writes the phase rate into the shared descriptor, so
guarded reactions animate at 0.25..0.75, slower for higher rows. The row pause
is a fallback used only when the attack pause is `0x7FFF`: in guard mode a
positive attack pause is active immediately, a negative one is staged, zero
clears, and flag `0x20000` suppresses both.

`guard_update_stance`:

| Lock | Guard input | Grounded | Next |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | released | yes | neutral |
| 0 | any | no | `(3,0x21)` |
| 0 | held | yes | stance `(0,5)` phase 1 |
| nonzero | any | yes | `(0,6)` phase 1 |
| nonzero | any | no | `(0,7)` phase 1 |

Stance calls it when `guard_state` reaches zero, `(0,7)` while grounded, and
`(0,6)` at phase 1 once the secondary timeline is positive and the lock
crosses zero. Exits go through `guard_stance_exit` and `guard_response_exit`.

## Rehit suppression

Two gates inside the accepted-hit router stop new responses; neither is a
hurtbox change or global invulnerability ([Collision](collision.md) owns
contact).

**State windows.** `hit_response_gate_bits` sets bit `0x10` unless
`rehit_classify_response_window` returns 1. The router drops the hit when the
low nibble is set without `0x10`, or when the nibble is clear, `0x10` is clear
and `0x20` is set. The classifier returns 1 in:

| Window | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `0x5D` | always |
| `0x40`, `0x41`, `0x45..0x47` | grounded with cursor above 3 |
| `0x3A`, `0x3B` | rejection count not positive |
| `0x36..0x39`, `0x3C`, `0x3D`, `0x3F`, `0x42..0x44`, `0x52/54/56/58`, `0x5A` | grounded after the action included airborne motion |
| `0x48`, `0x49` | that condition with more than 4 grounded updates, or phase 2 |
| `0x3E` | phase 2 |

Inside a window a hit passes only with a clear low nibble (attack flag
`0x200000`, or flags `0x11` on a non-jutsu attack: 158 records, 156
damaging, in 72 tables) and a clear `0x20` (`response_repeat_count` below 3,
and a different record or the same one at its expected repeat). Guard flag
`0x800000` is on 109 damaging records and `0x400000` on none. Guard states do
not match any window.

Rejected as invulnerability evidence: `fighter_participant_eligible`,
`fighter_placement_check_a/b`, `response_class_interaction/motion` and
`action_rewrite_logical_mask` classify states for other consumers.

**Rejection countdown.** While `hit_rejection_active`, router modes 0, 2 and 3
drop hits (mode 1 does not), `hit_classify_pair` rejects the attacker's request
before routing (unless its classifier returns exact zero), and the attacker's
pause is withheld. Simultaneous hits reach `hit_enter_trade` only when neither
count is positive.

| Writer | Value |
| --- | --- |
| attack `rejection_count` (`hit_init_rejection_count`, ordinary and guarded) | 0 clears, positive staged, negative active, `0x7FFF` untouched |
| ordinary event 0, attack `0x7FFF`, nothing pending | row lock value, rate-adjusted |
| guard row | 2 or 3 when the attack staged nothing |
| capped `0x3A/0x3B` repeat | 60 |
| Extra Hit counter receiver | 60 staged ([Extra Hit](extra_hit.md#receiver-response-and-exchange-limit)) |
| `0x5D` first event | 1 if inactive |
| `hit_set_rejection` | router clear on gate result 0; Ultimate Jutsu contest start sets 60 on both ([Ultimate Jutsu](../characters/ultimate_jutsu.md)) |
| recovery exits | 4 / 3 / 2 |
| `effect_7d_update` | cleared in grounded phases of listed responses |

The count decrements by 1.0 only without a pause but activates during one.
With attack pause `N` and positive `rejection_count` `M`, mode-0 hits are
dropped in updates `1..N+M`.

Authored `rejection_count` on damaging records: `0x7FFF` (1,462), 1 (761), 2
(173), 3 (33), 4 (18), 0 (16), negative (13), 5..16 (8). The sentinel uses the
row lock value: 5 for most light and airborne reactions, 120 for knockdowns
and launches. An Extra Hit clears the receiver's count when it starts.

## Hit count

`response_enter_ordinary` increments statistic 18 (ordinary hits, maximum
tracked) except for source type 4, `PL_ATK_DUMMYDROP`, attack category `0x2`,
or `status_flags & 0x01`; `guard_response_init` increments statistic 19 under
the same flag. `fighter_init` clears all 24 pairs with `stats_reset_block` and
then reloads them from a per-side bank
([Awakening](../characters/awakening.md#state-retained-across-the-native-rebuild)).
No in-match reset exists. `stats_condition` is the only reader
([Battle statistics](../session/battle_statistics.md#statistic-derived-conditions)).
